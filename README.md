##A Simple All Client-Side Demo##
This demo is used to get a http://campaigncog.com user started when integrating Campaigncog into your existing systems such as a hosted CRM. It is likely that you are going to want to dynamically insert the credentials so this is just the bare minimum for embedding the dashboard.

##Getting Started##

All you need to do to get the demo started is just replace the password and email section with your credentials. If you are integrating it into your own system it is suggested to supply the initial post with some serverside code.
